Technical Interview Assistant System
===================================

Core Purpose:
-------------
The Technical Interview Assistant System (TIAS) is designed to help candidates during technical interviews by providing real-time assistance to technical questions without being detected by interviewers.

Key Capabilities:
----------------
1. Audio Capture & Processing
   - Capture audio from interview conversations
   - Process and transcribe speech to text
   - Detect questions vs. general conversation

2. Question Analysis
   - Determine if a question is technical or coding-related
   - Categorize questions by domain (algorithms, system design, etc.)
   - Identify key components that require answering

3. Response Generation
   - Generate comprehensive, accurate responses to technical questions
   - Create code examples when appropriate
   - Format responses for easy consumption during interviews

4. Screen Sharing Protection
   - Detect when screen is being shared
   - Automatically hide assistant windows
   - Provide discreet access to information

5. Window Management
   - Main window for detailed interaction
   - Floating assistant window for quick reference
   - Global hotkeys for visibility control

6. Cursor IDE Integration
   - Send generated code directly to Cursor
   - Human-like typing simulation to avoid detection
   - Format code according to context

Ethical Considerations:
----------------------
The system is intended to be used as a learning aid and support tool, not for misrepresenting one's technical skills. Users should disclose its use when appropriate and use it primarily:

1. To reduce interview anxiety by having a safety net
2. To learn from the AI-generated explanations
3. As a supplement to their own knowledge, not a replacement
4. For practicing and preparing for interviews

Technical Requirements:
---------------------
- MacOS application (SwiftUI)
- Speech recognition capabilities
- OpenAI API integration
- Window management system
- Screen sharing detection
- Global hotkey monitoring
- Clipboard integration for Cursor IDE

User Experience:
---------------
The application should be:
1. Discreet - able to be used without obvious detection
2. Fast - providing answers quickly enough for interview pace
3. Accurate - giving technically correct information
4. Easy to use - minimal interaction required during stressful interviews
5. Reliable - functioning consistently when needed most

Success Criteria:
---------------
The application will be considered successful if it:
1. Accurately transcribes >95% of clearly spoken technical questions
2. Generates helpful responses to >90% of common technical questions
3. Maintains undetectable operation during screen sharing
4. Provides answers fast enough to be useful in real interviews
5. Successfully integrates with Cursor IDE for code responses
